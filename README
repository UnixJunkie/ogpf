OGPF - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework

This is a library for genetic programming in OCaml. It is structured so that a
wide variety of genetic programming (population-based algorithms, actuall)
projects can be easily composed.

---------------------
I'm making a snapshot -- the framework itself working. I have it doing my
stupid string evolution, which it hasn't yet completed. The cards are stacked
against the algo since deletions are easy but insertions nearly impossible. eh.

Thoughts [2003.03.22]
---------------------
Well, after a slight haiatus (ha!) I'm back at hacking on this thing. I've
finally taken the time to figure out how to work modules properly to do the
things I want to do. So far there are two pieces I've been working on,
stringGeotype.ml and pop.ml. The Pop module just holds a population, allowing
you to pull things out and put things in. The StringGenotype holds my first
evolving genomtype, in this case a simple string. The immediate goal is to do a
simple evolution from a randomly generated string to a specific static string.
The StringGenotype itself holds how to mutate and combine strings. There will
be one more class which then manages the population from generation to
generation. The combination and mutation code is definately genotype dependent,
but I'm not so sure that the code belongs in the genome itself since I will
most likely want to experiment on different mutation and combination routines
for the same genotype.
