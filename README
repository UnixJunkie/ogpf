OGPF - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework
------------------------------------------
This is a framework for genetic programming in OCaml. It is structured so that
a wide variety of genetic programming (population-based algorithms, actually)
projects can be easily composed.

It is also an experiment for myself in an extremely functorized programming
style. I am still working out both the details of the style and the structure
of the framework. All input is welcomed.

Documentation
-------------
Since nobody uses this except for me right now, all documentation is on my
website. Once there is enough documentation and enough interest, I will create
snapshots of the content there and drop it into this distribution. But for now
just see http://tlt42.org/wiki.pl/OGPF.
