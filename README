OGPF - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework
------------------------------------------
This is a framework for genetic programming in OCaml. It is structured so that
a wide variety of genetic programming (population-based algorithms, actually)
projects can be easily composed.

It is also an experiment for myself in an extremely functorized programming
style. I am still working out both the details of the style and the structure
of the framework. All input is welcomed.
